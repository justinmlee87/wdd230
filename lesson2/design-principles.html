                    <p>The Amazon homepage utilizes the Rule of Thirds principle by breaking the webpage in to 
                    sections using columns and rows forming a grid. Amazon specifically accomplishes this by 
                    separating highlighted items in to their own columns. The purpose of this is to highlight
                    deals or items that website visitors may find appealing. Amazon's goal is to allow consumers
                    to empathize better with their brand by highlighting specific products in sections.

                    <h2>Hicks Law</h2>
                    <h3>Walmart</h3>
                    <h3><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals">walmart.com/shop/deals</a></h3>
                    <img src="images/HicksLaw.jpg" alt="Walmart">
                    <p>The Walmart homepage utilizes Hicks Law, specifically when a user accesses their navigation
                    menus. By utilizing Hicks Law, walmart provides the consumer with a very large list of
                    options. The intention behind this is the exact purpose of Hicks Law which states 
                    "The more choices you present your user with, the longer it will take them to reach
                    a decision." The primary purpose behind this approach is to keep consumers on their
                    website longer and potentially lead to more sales due to a greater number of options.

                    <h3>AirBnB</h3>
                    <h3><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/579026877266226117?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A5348&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&photo_id=1357127235&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2023-10-10&check_out=2023-10-15&source_impression_id=p3_1695400066_kiq%2B1%2FqurlJQlx2T&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=1066248f-d3d2-4d2c-9425-160d0ea12d39">AirBnB.com</a></h3>
                    <img src="images/FittsLaw.jpg" alt="AirBnB">
                    <p>AirBnB utilizes Fitts Law in their homepage by locking and enlarging the reserve icon
                    and reservation information. This specifically highlights the button to reserve to the user
                    with the intention of prompting the user to book a reservation. Fitts Law states "The time to
                    move to a target depends on how big it is and on how far away it is." By enlarging the reservation
                    icon, AirBnB makes it the most convenient part of the booking process.
